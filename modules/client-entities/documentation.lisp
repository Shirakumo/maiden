This class already handles the association/storage of user and
channel objects. User ENSURE-USER/CHANNEL to register users and

If you need to subclass USER or CHANNEL --which you probably
should anyway-- you should subclass SIMPLE-USER and SIMPLE-CHANNEL
instead, and override ENSURE-USER and ENSURE-CHANNEL to create
instances of the appropriate classes instead.

You will have to make sure that, when a user enters a channel, the
channel is registered to the user via FIND-CHANNEL on the user,
and the user is registered to the channel via FIND-USER on the
channel. The same goes when a user leaves a channel. However, you
do not need to do anything should a channel or a user be removed
from the client altogether, as in that case this generic system
can figure out what to do on its own and ensure consistency.
