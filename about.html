It can help you build a chat bot, or a general chat client. It also offers a variety of parts that should make it much easier to write a client for a new chat protocol.</p> <h2>How To Use Maiden as a Bot</h2> <p>If you only care about using Maiden to set up a bot of some kind, the steps to do so are rather straightforward. First we'll want to load in Maiden and all of the modules and components that you'd like to use in your bot.</p> <pre><code>(ql:quickload '(maiden maiden-irc maiden-command maiden-silly))</code></pre> <p>And then we'll create a core with instances of the consumers added to it as we'd like them to be.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defvar">defvar</a> *core* (<a href="#MAIDEN:MAKE-CORE">maiden:make-core</a>
                 '(:maiden-irc :nickname &quot;MaidenTest&quot; :host &quot;irc.freenode.net&quot; :channels (&quot;##testing&quot;))
                 :maiden-command
                 :maiden-silly))</code></pre> <p>The make-core command takes either package names (as strings or symbols) of consumers to add, or the direct class name of a consumer. In the former case it'll try to find the appropriate consumer class name on its own.</p> <p>And that's it. <code><a href="#MAIDEN:MAKE-CORE">make-core</a></code> will create a core, instantiate all the consumers, add them to it, and start everything up. A loot of the modules provided for Maiden will make use of some kind of configuration or persistent storage. For the management thereof, see the <a href="modules/storage/">storage</a> subsystem.</p> <h2>How To Use Maiden as a Framework to Develop With</h2> <p>In order to use Maiden as a framework, you'll first want to define your own system and package as usual for a project. For now we'll just use the <code>maiden-user</code> package to play around in. Next we'll want to define a consumer. This can be done with <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-CONSUMER">define-consumer</a></code>.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/in-package">in-package</a> #:maiden-user)
(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-CONSUMER">define-consumer</a> ping-notifier (<a href="#MAIDEN:AGENT">agent</a>)
  ())</code></pre> <p>Usually you'll want to define an agent. Agents can only exist once on a core. We'll go through an example for a client later. Now, from here on out we can define our own methods and functions that specialise or act on the consumer class as you'd be used to from general CLOS programming. Next, we'll define our own event that we'll use to send &quot;ping requests&quot; to the system.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-EVENT">define-event</a> ping (<a href="#MAIDEN:PASSIVE-EVENT">passive-event</a>)
  ())</code></pre> <p>The event is defined as a <code><a href="#MAIDEN:PASSIVE-EVENT">passive-event</a></code> as it is not directly requesting an action to be taken, but rather informs the system of a ping that's happening. Now, in order to actually make the consumer interact with the event system however, we'll also want to define handlers. This can be done with <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-HANDLER">define-handler</a></code>.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-HANDLER">define-handler</a> (ping-notifier ping-receiver ping) (c ev)
  (v:info :ping &quot;Received a ping: ~a&quot; ev))</code></pre> <p>This defines a handler called <code>ping-receiver</code> on our <code>ping-notifier</code> consumer. It also specifies that it will listen for events of type <code>ping</code>. The arglist afterwards says that the consumer instance is bound to <code>c</code> and the event instance to <code>ev</code>. The body then simply logs an informational message using <a href="https://shinmera.github.io/verbose">Verbose</a>.</p> <p>Let's test this out real quick.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defvar">defvar</a> *core* (<a href="#MAIDEN:MAKE-CORE">make-core</a> 'ping-notifier))

(<a href="#MAIDEN:DO-ISSUE">do-issue</a> *core* ping)</code></pre> <p>That should print the status message to the REPL as expected. And that's most of everything there is to using this system. Note that in order to do actually useful things, you'll probably want to make use of some of the preexisting subsystems that the Maiden project delivers aside from the core. Those will help you with users, channels, accounts, commands, networking, storage, and so forth. Also keep in mind that you can make use of the features that <a href="https://shinmera.github.io/deeds">Deeds</a> offers on its own as well, such as filtering expressions for handlers.</p> <p>Now let's take a look at a primitive kind of client. The client will simply be able to write to a file through events.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-CONSUMER">define-consumer</a> file-client (<a href="#MAIDEN:CLIENT">client</a>)
  ((file :initarg :file :accessor file))
  (:default-initargs :file (<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/error">error</a> &quot;FILE required.&quot;)))
  
(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-EVENT">define-event</a> write-event (<a href="#MAIDEN:CLIENT-EVENT">client-event</a> active-event)
  ((sequence :initarg :sequence))
  (:default-initargs :sequence (<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/error">error</a> &quot;SEQUENCE required.&quot;)))</code></pre> <p>We've made the <code>write-event</code> a <code><a href="#MAIDEN:CLIENT-EVENT">client-event</a></code> since it needs to be specific to a client we want to write to, and we've made it an <code><a href="#MAIDEN:ACTIVE-EVENT">active-event</a></code> since it requests something to happen. Now let's define our handler that will take care of actually writing the sequence to file.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-HANDLER">define-handler</a> (file-client writer write-event) (c ev sequence)
  :match-consumer 'client
  (<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/with-open-file">with-open-file</a> (<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/stream">stream</a> (file c) :direction :output :if-exists :append :if-does-not-exist :create)
    (<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/write-sequence">write-sequence</a> sequence stream)))</code></pre> <p>The <code>:match-consumer</code> option modifies the handler's filter in such a way that the filter will only pass events whose <code><a href="#MAIDEN:CLIENT">client</a></code> slot contains the same <code>file-client</code> instance as the current handler instance belongs to. This is important, as each instance of <code>file-client</code> will receive its own instances of its handlers on a core. Without this option, the <code>write-event</code> would be handled by every instance of the <code>file-client</code> regardless of which instance the event was intended for. Also note that we added a <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/sequence">sequence</a></code> argument to the handler's arglist. This argument will be filled with the appropriate slot from the event. If no such slot could be found, an error is signalled.</p> <p>Time to test it out. We'll just reuse the core from above.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:ADD-TO-CORE">add-to-core</a> *core* '(file-client :file &quot;~/foo&quot; :name :foo)
                    '(file-client :file &quot;~/bar&quot; :name :bar))

(<a href="#MAIDEN:DO-ISSUE">do-issue</a> *core* write-event :sequence &quot;foo&quot; :client (<a href="#MAIDEN:CONSUMER">consumer</a> :foo *core*))
(<a href="#MAIDEN:DO-ISSUE">do-issue</a> *core* write-event :sequence &quot;bar&quot; :client (<a href="#MAIDEN:CONSUMER">consumer</a> :bar *core*))

(alexandria:read-file-into-string &quot;~/foo&quot;) ; =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;
(alexandria:read-file-into-string &quot;~/bar&quot;) ; =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;</code></pre> <p>As you can see, the events were directed to the appropriate handler instances according to the client we wanted, and the files thus contain what we expect them to.</p> <p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that it is also possible to dynamically add and remove handlers at runtime, and even do so for handlers that are not associated with a particular consumer. This is often useful when you need to wait for a response event from somewhere. To handle the logic of doing this asynchronously and retain the impression of an imperative flow, Maiden offers --just as Deeds does-- a <code><a href="#MAIDEN:WITH-AWAITING">with-awaiting</a></code> macro. It can be used as follows:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MAIDEN:WITH-AWAITING">with-awaiting</a> (<a href="#MAIDEN:CORE">core</a> event-type) (ev some-field)
    (<a href="#MAIDEN:DO-ISSUE">do-issue</a> core initiating-event)
  :timeout 20
  some-field)</code></pre> <p><code><a href="#MAIDEN:WITH-AWAITING">with-awaiting</a></code> is very similar to <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-HANDLER">define-handler</a></code>, with the exception that it doesn't take a name, and instead of a consumer name at the beginning it needs a core or consumer instance. It also takes one extra option that is otherwise unused, the <code>:timeout</code>. Another required extra is the &quot;setup form&quot; after the arglist. In order to properly manage everything and ensure no race conditions may occur in the system, you must initiate the process that will prompt the eventual response event in this setup form. If you initiate it before then, the response event might be sent out before the temporary handler is set up in the system and it'll appear as if it never arrived at all.</p> <p>And that's pretty much all of the basics. As mentioned above, take a look at the subsystems this project includes, as they will help you with all sorts of common tasks and problems revolving around chat systems and so on.</p> <h2>Core Documentation</h2> <p>Before understanding Maiden, it is worth it to understand <a href="https://shinmera.github.io/deeds">Deeds</a>, if only at a surface level. Maiden builds on it rather heavily.</p> <h3>Core</h3> <p>A <code><a href="#MAIDEN:CORE">core</a></code> is the central part of a Maiden configuration. It is responsible for managing and orchestrating the other components of the system. You can have multiple cores running simultaneously within the same lisp image, and can even share components between them.</p> <p>More specifically, a Core is made up of an event-loop and a set of consumers. The event-loop is responsible for delivering events to handlers. Consumers are responsible for attaching handlers to the event-loop. The operations you will most likely want to perform on a core are thus: issuing events to it by <code><a href="#MAIDEN:ISSUE">issue</a></code>, adding consumers to it by <code><a href="#MAIDEN:ADD-CONSUMER">add-consumer</a></code>, or removing a consumer from it by <code><a href="#MAIDEN:REMOVE-CONSUMER">remove-consumer</a></code>.</p> <p>In order to make it easier on your to create a useful core with consumers added to it, you can make use of the <code><a href="#MAIDEN:MAKE-CORE">make-core</a></code> and <code><a href="#MAIDEN:ADD-TO-CORE">add-to-core</a></code> functions.</p> <h3>Event</h3> <p>An <code><a href="#MAIDEN:EVENT">event</a></code> is an object that represents a change in the system. Events can be used to either represent a change that has occurred, or to represents a request for a change to happen. These are called <code><a href="#MAIDEN:PASSIVE-EVENT">passive-event</a></code>s and <code><a href="#MAIDEN:ACTIVE-EVENT">active-event</a></code>s respectively.</p> <p>Generally you will use events in the following ways:</p> <ol> <li>Consuming them by writing a handler that takes events of a particular type and does something in response to them.</li> <li>Define new event classes that describe certain behaviour.</li> <li>Emitting them by writing components that inform the system about changes.</li> </ol> <h3>Consumer</h3> <p>A <code><a href="#MAIDEN:CONSUMER">consumer</a></code> is a class that represents a component in the system. Each consumer can have a multitude of handlers tied to it, which will react to events in the system. Consumers come in two basic supertypes, <code><a href="#MAIDEN:AGENT">agent</a></code>s and <code><a href="#MAIDEN:CLIENT">client</a></code>s. Agents are consumers that should only exist on a core once, as they implement functionality that would not make sense to be multiplexed in some way. Clients on the other hand represent some kind of bridge to an outside system, and naturally should be allowed to have multiple instances on the same core.</p> <p>Thus developing a set of commands or an interface of some kind would probably lead to an agent, whereas interfacing with a service like XMPP would lead to a client.</p> <p>Defining a consumer should happen with <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-CONSUMER">define-consumer</a></code>, which is similar to the standard <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defclass">defclass</a></code>, but ensures that the superclasses and metaclasses are properly set up.</p> <h3>Handler</h3> <p><code>handler</code>s are objects that hold a function that performs certain actions when a particular event is issued onto the core. Each handler is tied to a particular consumer and is removed or added to the core's event-loop when the consumer is removed or added to the core.</p> <p>Handler definition happens through one of <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-HANDLER">define-handler</a></code>, <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-FUNCTION-HANDLER">define-function-handler</a></code>, <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-INSTRUCTION">define-instruction</a></code>, or <code><a href="#MAIDEN:DEFINE-QUERY">define-query</a></code>. Which each successively build on the last to provide a broader shorthand for common requirements. Note that the way in which a handler actually receives its events can differ. Have a look at the Deeds' documentation to see what handler classes are available.</p> <h2>Subsystems</h2> <p>Included in the Maiden project are a couple of subsystems that extend the core functionality.</p> <ul> <li><a href="modules/api-access/">API Access</a> -- Helper functions to access remote APIs over HTTP.</li> <li><a href="modules/client-entities/">Client Entities</a> -- Common entities for clients and remote systems.</li> <li><a href="modules/networking/">Networking</a> -- Client mixins to handle network connections.</li> <li><a href="modules/serialize/">Serialize</a> -- Data to wire serialization.</li> <li><a href="modules/storage/">Storage</a> -- Configuration and data storage.</li> </ul> <h2>Existing Clients</h2> <p>The Maiden project also includes a few standard clients that can be used right away.</p> <ul> <li><a href="clients/irc/">IRC</a> -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a> client.</li> <li><a href="clients/lichat/">Lichat</a> -- <a href="https://shirakumo.github.io/lichat">Lichat</a> client.</li> <li><a href="clients/relay/">Relay</a> -- Maiden relay.

Consumers are responsible for issuing and responding to
events that happen on a core. They do this by having a number
of handler definitions tied to them, which are instantiated
into proper handlers when they are added to a core. These
handlers are then added to the core's event-loop in order to
react to events. See the Deeds library for information on how
the event-loop and handlers work in detail.

Consumers are divided into two classes, ones of which only a
single instance should exist on the core, and ones of which
many may exist on the core. The former are called AGENTS, and
the latter are called CLIENTS. The former usually provide
functionality that is reactionary in some sense. The latter
usually provide some form of connection to another entity and
primarily provide events rather than consuming them. You should
not inherit directly from CONSUMER therefore, and rather pick
either CLIENT or AGENT, depending on which of the two is more
suitable for the kind of consumer you want to write for the
system.

Consumer classes must inherit from the CONSUMER-CLASS class,
which is responsible for ensuring that handler definitions get
properly instantiated and managed over consumer instances.

In order to easily define consumer classes with the appropriate
superclass and metaclass, you can use DEFINE-CONSUMER.

In order to add handlers to the consumer, use DEFINE-HANDLER.

Each consumer has a LOCK that can be used to synchronise
access to the consumer from different parts in the system.
Since Deeds, and Maiden by extension, is highly parallel most
of the time, locking of resources and access to the consumer
from different handlers is vital.

The list of handler instances is held in the HANDLERS slot.
The list of cores the consumer is on is held in the CORES slot.

You can start and stop all the handlers on a consumer by the
usual Deeds START and STOP functions.

After the initialisation of a consumer, the consumer instance
is pushed onto the INSTANCES list of its class by way of a
weak-pointer. It will also turn all of its effective-handlers
into actual handler instances by way of INSTANTIATE-HANDLER and
push them onto its HANDLERS list.

The core is responsible for managing events, consumers, and
their handlers. It uses two (!) event-loops in the back to
handle event delivery. The first loop, called the primary
loop is where most handlers live. It is (by default) of type
PRIMARY-LOOP and should be fairly speed in delivery, at
the cost that adding and removing handlers will be slow. The
second loop, called the blocking loop is where temporary
handlers that only exist for hopefully a short time live. It
is (by default) of type BLOCK-LOOP and is not optimised
for fast delivery, but much faster at removing and adding
handlers. Thus, whenever you wait for an event for a one-time
request, the handler should be added to the block loop.

Calling DE/REGISTER-HANDLER on a core will automatically add
it to the primary loop. If you want to change the blocking
loop you will have to access it directly.

When an event is ISSUEd onto the core, it is ISSUEd onto the
primary loop and then ISSUEd onto the block loop. The
behaviour for when an event is directly HANDLEd by the core
is analogous.

An event is an object that represents a change that occurs
in the system. It may also carry relevant information about
the change. Events can also be used to signify requests for
things to happen in the system.

Events need to be ISSUEd onto a core, where they will then
be dispatched to HANDLERs that can process it.

            clash on multiple consumer instances on the same core.
EVENT-TYPE  must be a base class for all events that the handler

ARGS        must be a list of arguments, of which the first two will
            be bound to the consumer instance and the event

            bindings of the event.
BODY        a number of extra handler definition options as a plist
            followed directly by a number of forms to evaluate upon
            receiving an event.

The body options are evaluated and passed as class initargs to the
resulting handler instance once one is constructed. Note that as such
the values will be shared across all instances of the handler defined
here. Also note that there are two options which are exempt from
this and play special roles:

  :DELIVERY-FUNCTION This option is already provided by default.
                     Supplying it manually will mean that the body
                     forms of the DEFINE-HANDLER will be ignored.
  :MATCH-CONSUMER    Should be a slot name of the event that needs
                     to match the consumer for the event to be handled.
                     You'll want to use this option for handlers of
                     clients, in order to ensure that the handler from
                     the client instance that matches the client the
                     event is intended for is called.

In effect this constructs an appropriate ABSTRACT-HANDLER instance
and calls UPDATE-HANDLER with it on the consumer class.

This is essentially the same as DEFINE-FUNCTION-HANDLER with
the following additions:
- INSTRUCTION-EVENT is always injected as a superclass.
- A function of the same name as the instruction is generated that
  creates the appropriate event and sends it off to a core.

This thus allows you to simulate a standard function interface
for code that runs over the event-loop. Note that the generated
function will not wait for a response to the event and immediately
returns. The returned value is the generated event instance.

This is similar to DEFINE-INSTRUCTION, with the exception that
possibly two events (one for issue and one for response) are
generated, and that the issue function will await a response
and return with the intended return value, thus simulating a
complete function API over the event system.

If no explicit EVENT-RESPONSE-TYPE is specified, a generic
response event is used instead. See RESPOND.
