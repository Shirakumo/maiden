## Todo:
- Document everything.
- Insurance that all the same modules are loaded across the
  different cores, otherwise serialising of event objects
  is going to fail.
  - This might need a better solution, one that does not
    require every module along the path to have the modules
    loaded and only the endpoints. The usefulness of this
    needs to be evaluated however.
  - Additionally, some objects simply cannot be serialised
    so there might have to be a mechanism to automate rmeoval
    or substitution thereof.
- Automate error handling.
