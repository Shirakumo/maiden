    "Maximum number of characters to be allowed in a single message event.

The default is set to 360.
This leaves 152 characters to encode the preamble and
CRLF of a message. That should be enough while still
sending a fairly long message over the net. Calculating
the limit precisely would involve querying the hostname
as seen by others as well as the precise manner in
which things are encoded on the wire. Since that is
somewhat too complicated and 360 is still plenty long
we settle for this compromise. The protocols don't
actually say anything about the length restrictions of
the username, so we cannot make a worst-case estimate
limit. However, we do know that the hostname is limited
to 63 characters, we need 2 for the line ending, ~10
for the command, and ~36 for the nickname. The nick
length here being overly long especially considering
the initial RFCs limit it to 9, which is way too short
to be relied upon. Either way, 152 should be a good
limit.")

This does not always work as the IRC spec is very
lenient on what a user, channel, or server may call
themselves, so in sufficiently bad situations it can
be impossible to tell and this will fail, with
potentially horrendous consequences.
