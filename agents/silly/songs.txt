Here's to you Nicola and Bart, rest forever here in our hearts
I give my life, not for honor, but for you, snake eater
Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack, and you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may ask yourself, "Am I right, am I wrong?", and you may say to yourself, "My God, what have I done?"
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
I'm nuclear, I'm wild, I'm breaking up inside
You're face to face with the man who sold the world
Just wanna play video games, everything else is really lame
All this pain reminds me of what I am, I'll live, I'll become all I need to be
Woa hoooooooooooooo
Shevalin, nie miosa
This is my escape, I'm running through this world, and I'm not looking back
