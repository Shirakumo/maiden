usual body option.

not be passed to DEFINE-FUNCTION-HANDLER:

  sequence you want, the system will be able to deal with it.

  not the same as the EVENT argument. The EVENT argument is
  bound to the dispatching event of the command, which is
  usually what you want to inspect and reply to. The command-
  event may be useful in some circumstances, but usually it
  will just be a carrier for the arguments, which will
  already have been bound to distinct variables.

body, a REPLY is done to the dispatching event with the
message set to the error printed as a string.
