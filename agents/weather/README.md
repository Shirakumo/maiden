## About
This agent provides weather and forecast information using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API. It also uses the [maiden-location](../location/) system for location resolution. It thus provides users the ability to request both current weather and forecast information for their location.

Simply see the symbol index for the available commands and functions. They should be self-explanatory.
